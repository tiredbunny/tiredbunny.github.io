**Description**: 

This game was our entry for a game jam event at [gamedev.net](https://www.gamedev.net/). The game’s goal is to destroy as many towers as possible, which are made up of dominos. You jump from one domino to another and start a chain reaction to make the towers fall.

**Game engine**: UE4

Here is a YouTube video of a judge (of the game jam) playing the second level on hard mode. Due to a bug, the difficulty is displayed as “Easy” in some of the game menus. However, in reality, the judge is playing on hard difficulty.
